# Installing nono

## Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap lukehinds/nono 
brew install nono
```

<Note>
  The package is not in homebrew official yet, [give us a star](https://github.com/lukehinds/nono) to help raise our profile for when request approval
</Note>

## Linux Package Managers

We are in the process of packaging nono for popular Linux distributions. In the meantime, you can use the prebuilt binaries or build from source.

## Building from Source

See the [Development Guide](development/index.md) for instructions on building nono from source.

## Where next?

I expect you want to get going with nono and a coding agent. Here are some of the current documented clients
- [Claude Code](/clients/claude-code.md)
- [OpenClaw](/clients/openclaw.md)
- [OpenCode](/clients/opencode.md)

<Note>
  If there is an Agent you want supported please open an issue or PR to add it! Its fairly straightforward to add new ones, and we will be adding more over time.
</Note>

Alternatively, you can check out the [Usage](/usage) guide to learn how to use nono.
