description: Understanding nono's security guarantees, assumptions, and limitations
---

nono implements a capability-based security model using kernel-level enforcement. This page explains the security guarantees, assumptions, and limitations.

## Core Principle

**Deny by default, allow explicitly.**

When you run a command through nono, it can only access what you explicitly grant. Everything else is blocked at the kernel level.

## Trust Boundaries

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        TRUSTED                              │
│  - Your operating system kernel                             │
│  - nono binary (applies sandbox before exec)                │
│  - Paths you explicitly grant access to                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │

                              │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                       UNTRUSTED                             │
│  - The command/agent being executed                         │
│  - Any child processes it spawns                            │
│  - Any libraries it loads                                   │
│  - Any network connections it makes (if allowed)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## What nono Protects Against

### Path Traversal Attacks

An agent cannot use `../` sequences to escape allowed directories:

```bash
# Agent tries: cat ../../etc/passwd
# Result: Permission denied (kernel blocks it)
```

### Symlink Escapes

Paths are canonicalized at grant time. An agent cannot create a symlink pointing outside the sandbox:

```bash
# Agent tries: ln -s /etc/passwd ./escape && cat ./escape
# Result: Permission denied (symlink target is outside allowed paths)
```

### Credential Theft

Sensitive paths are blocked by default, even if a parent directory is allowed:

- `~/.ssh/` - SSH keys
- `~/.aws/` - AWS credentials
- `~/.gnupg/` - GPG keys
- `~/.kube/` - Kubernetes config
- Shell history and config files
- And more...

### Network Exfiltration

Network is allowed by default. Use `--net-block` to completely disable network access and prevent an agent from making any outbound connections.

### Privilege Escalation

The sandbox is applied before exec(). There is no window where the agent runs with elevated privileges.

### Child Process Escape

All child processes inherit the sandbox. An agent cannot spawn an unrestricted subprocess.

## What nono Does NOT Protect Against

### Kernel Exploits

If the kernel itself has a vulnerability, an attacker with code execution could potentially escape the sandbox. This is true of any sandboxing solution.

### Covert Channels

An agent could potentially leak small amounts of information through timing side channels, CPU usage patterns, etc. nono does not attempt to prevent covert channels.

### Resource Exhaustion

nono does not limit CPU, memory, or disk usage. A malicious agent could attempt denial-of-service through resource exhaustion.

### Data Within Allowed Paths

If you grant access to a directory, the agent can read/write anything in that directory. nono cannot protect files within allowed paths.

### TOCTOU Races

There is a small window between path canonicalization and sandbox application where a time-of-check-time-of-use race could theoretically occur. This window is minimized but not eliminated.

## Sensitive Path Protection

nono blocks access to sensitive paths by default, even if a parent directory is explicitly allowed:

| Path | Contains |
|------|----------|
| `~/.ssh/` | SSH private keys |
| `~/.aws/` | AWS credentials |
| `~/.gnupg/` | GPG private keys |
| `~/.kube/` | Kubernetes credentials |
| `~/.docker/` | Docker credentials |
| `~/.npmrc` | npm auth tokens |
| `~/.netrc` | Network credentials |
| `~/.gitcredentials` | Git credentials |
| `~/.bash_history` | Command history |
| `~/.zsh_history` | Command history |
| `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc` | Shell configs (may contain secrets) |

## Security Properties

### Irreversibility

Once the sandbox is applied, there is no API to expand or remove it. Not even nono itself can undo the restrictions.

### Fail-Closed

If sandbox initialization fails, nono exits with an error rather than running the command unrestricted.

### Minimal Attack Surface

nono applies the sandbox and immediately exec()s into the target command. It does not remain running as a supervisor (in Phase 1).

## Best Practices

1. **Grant minimal access** - Only allow what the command actually needs
2. **Use read-only where possible** - Use `--read` instead of `--allow` for source directories
3. **Block network when not needed** - Use `--net-block` for offline operations like builds or tests
4. **Test with dry-run** - Use `--dry-run` to preview capabilities before execution
5. **Review agent output** - Even sandboxed agents can produce malicious output files
