title: nono vs Containers
description: When to use nono, Docker, or both for sandboxing AI agents
---

nono and containers (Docker, Podman, etc.) provide different isolation models. This guide helps you choose the right tool for your use case.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | nono | Docker Container |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Startup time | ~0ms | ~100-500ms |
| Setup required | None | Dockerfile, daemon |
| Filesystem model | Path-level allow/deny | Separate filesystem |
| Works on host files | Yes (directly) | Requires volume mounts |
| Credential protection | Automatic blocklist | Manual (don't mount) |
| Network isolation | On/off | Full namespace |
| Resource limits | No | Yes (cgroups) |
| Process isolation | No | Yes (PID namespace) |

## When to Use nono

**nono excels when you need:**

### Zero-Latency Startup

```bash
# Instant startup - no container overhead
nono run --allow . -- claude-code

# Compare to Docker
docker run -v $(pwd):/work -it my-agent  # 100-500ms+ overhead per invocation
```

### Direct Access to Your Working Directory

AI coding agents need to read and modify your actual source files. With nono, this works naturally:

```bash
# Agent can edit files in current directory
nono run --allow . -- aider
```

With Docker, you need will need to create volume mounts and set permission issues:

```bash
# Volume mounts can cause UID/GID mismatches
docker run -v $(pwd):/work -u $(id -u):$(id -g) my-agent
```

### Automatic Credential Protection

nono blocks sensitive paths by default, even if you allow a parent directory:

```bash
# Allows ~/projects but still blocks ~/.ssh, ~/.aws, etc.
nono run --allow ~/projects -- agent
```

With Docker, you must be careful not to mount sensitive directories:

```bash
# Easy to accidentally expose secrets
docker run -v $HOME:/home/user my-agent  # Dangerous!
```

### Zero Configuration

nono requires no setup - just install and run:

```bash
brew install nono
nono run --allow . -- my-agent
```

Docker requires:
- Docker daemon running
- Dockerfile for custom images
- Understanding of volumes, networks, users
- Image pulls and builds

## When to Use Containers

Containers are better when you need:

### Full Environment Isolation

If the agent needs specific system libraries, language runtimes, or tools:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11
RUN pip install numpy pandas tensorflow
```

nono runs in your existing environment - it doesn't provide a separate runtime.

### Resource Limits

Containers can limit CPU, memory, and I/O:

```bash
docker run --memory=2g --cpus=1 my-agent
```

nono does not limit resources. A runaway agent can consume all available CPU/memory.

### Process Isolation

Containers have separate PID namespaces - processes inside can't see or signal host processes:

```bash
# Inside container, can only see container processes
docker run my-agent ps aux  # Shows only container processes
```

nono shares the host PID namespace - the sandboxed process can see (but not necessarily interact with) other processes.

### Reproducible Environments

For CI/CD or sharing exact environments:

```bash
# Same environment everywhere
docker run my-org/agent:v1.2.3 -- run-tests
```

## Using Both Together

For maximum security, combine nono with containers:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nono
ENTRYPOINT ["nono", "run", "--allow", "/work"]
```

```bash
# Defense in depth: container + nono
docker run -v $(pwd):/work my-nono-agent -- claude-code
```

This gives you:
- Container's namespace isolation
- Container's resource limits
- nono's path-level filesystem control
- nono's automatic credential blocking

## Threat Model Comparison

### What nono Protects Against

- Reading/writing files outside allowed paths
- Accessing credentials (~/.ssh, ~/.aws, etc.)
- Running blocked commands (rm, dd, etc.)
- Network access (when blocked)

### What Containers Protect Against

- All of the above (but with a fair amount of configuration)
- Process visibility and signaling
- Resource exhaustion (with limits)
- Environment contamination

### What Neither Protects Against

- Kernel vulnerabilities
- Side-channel attacks
- Prompt Injection (which no one can fully prevent)
- Social engineering (agent convinces you to run dangerous command)

## Performance Comparison

### Startup Time

```bash
# nono: instant
time nono run --allow . -- echo hello
# real    0m0.005s

# Docker (warm, image cached)
time docker run alpine echo hello
# real    0m0.350s

# Docker (cold, needs pull)
time docker run alpine echo hello
# real    0m2.500s
```

### Memory Overhead

- **nono**: ~0 MB (just applies sandbox and execs)
- **Docker**: ~10-50 MB per container (runtime overhead)

### Disk Usage

- **nono**: ~2 MB binary
- **Docker**: 100 MB+ per image (varies widely)

## Migration Guide

### From Docker to nono

If you're currently using Docker just for sandboxing:

```bash
# Before: Docker
docker run -v $(pwd):/work -w /work python:3.11 python script.py

# After: nono (uses your installed Python)
nono run --allow . -- python script.py
```

## Decision Flowchart

```
Do you need a different OS to the host?
├── Yes → Use containers
└── No
    │
    Do you need resource limits (CPU/memory)?
    ├── Yes → Use containers (or both)
    └── No
        │
        Do you need process isolation?
        ├── Yes → Use containers (or both)
        └── No
            │
            Is startup time critical?
            ├── Yes → Use nono
            └── No
                │
                Do you need path-level filesystem control?
                ├── Yes → Use nono (or both)
                └── No → Either works
```
