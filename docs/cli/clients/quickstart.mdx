description: Get started using nono with your preferred AI coding agent
---

nono works with any CLI tool, but these guides walk through setup and best practices for popular AI coding agents.

## Supported Clients

| Client | Profile | Network | Description |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| [Claude Code](/cli/clients/claude-code) | `claude-code` | Allowed | Anthropic's CLI coding agent |
| [OpenCode](/cli/clients/opencode) | `opencode` | Allowed | Open-source AI coding assistant |
| [OpenClaw](/cli/clients/openclaw) | `openclaw` | Allowed | Multi-channel AI agent platform |

## Quick Start

Every supported client has a built-in profile. Use it with a single flag:

```bash
nono run --profile <name> -- <command>
```

For example:

```bash
# Claude Code
nono run --profile claude-code -- claude

# OpenCode
nono run --profile opencode -- opencode

# OpenClaw gateway
nono run --profile openclaw -- openclaw gateway
```

## Using a Different Client?

nono is agent-agnostic. If your tool isn't listed here, you can run it directly with capability flags:

```bash
nono run --allow . -- my-agent
```

Or create a custom profile. See [Security Profiles](/cli/security/profiles) for the profile format and how to create your own.

## What the Sandbox Does

When you run a client through nono:

1. Only the directories and files you grant are accessible
2. Sensitive paths (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, etc.) are blocked by default
3. Network can be allowed or blocked per-profile
4. All child processes inherit the same restrictions
5. The sandbox cannot be escaped or expanded at runtime

See [Security Model](/cli/security) for full details.
