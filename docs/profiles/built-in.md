## Requesting New Profiles

If you'd like a built-in profile for a tool not listed here:

1. Open an issue on the [nono GitHub repository](https://github.com/lukehinds/nono/issues)
2. Include:
   - Tool name and repository URL
   - Required filesystem access patterns
   - Network requirements
   - Any special considerations

Built-in profiles are reviewed for security before inclusion.

## Overriding Built-in Profiles

CLI flags always take precedence over profile settings:

```bash
# Use claude-code profile but block network
nono run --profile claude-code --net-block -- claude

# Add extra directory access
nono run --profile claude-code --allow ~/other-project -- claude
```

You can also create a user profile with the same name to override a built-in profile entirely.
